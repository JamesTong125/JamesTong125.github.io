                                        League of Legends (LOL for short) is a popular MOBA game that has over 150 different champions you can play. I enjoy playing this game because every single game has a different combination of champions meaning every single game is a brand new and novel experrience.

                                        Overwatch 2 is a new and long-awited sequel of the popular game Overwatch. I enjoy playing this game as it is a fast-paced low commmitment game. It is a really easy game to just pick up and play.

                                        Valorant is a popular plant-the-bomb FPS game with over 15 different agents to play. I enjoy playing this game as it is a very competitive game about out-aiming your opponents.

                                        Osu is a rhythm game that required you too click circles by moving your cursor around. I enjoy playing this game as it is fun when I can beat a really hard beatmap, I also enjoy music.

                                        Teamfight Tactics is an autobattler that uses the champions from League of Legends. I enjoy playing this game as it is a game that only requires brain-power and doesn't really have mechanics, easy to play when my hands are tired.
